        <h1>History</h1>

        <p>In 1923, Hugo Boss founded his own clothing company in Metzingen, Germany, where it is still based. In
            1924, he started a factory along with two partners. The company produced shirts, jackets, work clothing,
            sportswear and raincoats. Due to the economic climate of Germany at the time, Boss was forced into
            bankruptcy. In 1931, he reached an agreement with his creditors, leaving him with six sewing machines to
            start again.
        </p>

        <h3>Manufacturing for the Nazi Party</h3>

        <p>That same year, Hugo Boss became a member of the Nazi Party, receiving the membership number 508 889, and a
            sponsoring member ("Förderndes Mitglied") of the Schutzstaffel (SS). He also joined the German Labour Front
            in 1936, the Reich Air Protection Association in 1939, and the National Socialist People's Welfare in 1941.
            He was also a member of the Reichskriegerbund and the Reichsbund for physical exercises. After joining
            these organizations, his sales increased from 38,260 RM ($26,993 U.S. dollars in 1932) to over 3,300,000 RM
            in 1941. Though he claimed in a 1934–35 advertisement that he had been a "supplier for National Socialist
            uniforms since 1924", it is probable that he did not begin to supply them until 1928 at the earliest. This
            is the year he became a Reichszeugmeisterei-licensed supplier of uniforms to the Sturmabteilung (SA),
            Schutzstaffel, Hitler Youth, National Socialist Motor Corps, and other party organizations.
        </p>

        <p>
            By the third quarter of 1932, the all-black SS uniform was designed by SS members Karl Diebitsch (artist)
            and Walter Heck (graphic designer). The Hugo Boss company was one of the companies that produced these black
            uniforms for the SS. By 1938, the firm was focused on producing Wehrmacht uniforms and later also uniforms
            for the Waffen-SS.
        </p>

        <p>
            Heinrich Himmler in an SS uniform, of a type manufactured by Hugo Boss, visiting Dachau Concentration Camp.
            During the Second World War, Hugo Boss employed 140 forced labourers, the majority of them women. In
            addition to these workers, 40 French prisoners of war also worked for the company briefly between October
            1940 - April 1941. According to German historian Henning Kober, the company managers were fervent National
            Socialists who were all great admirers of Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hugo Boss had a photograph in his apartment
            of him with Hitler, taken at the Berghof, Hitler's Obersalzberg retreat.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because of his early NS Party membership, his financial support of the SS and the uniforms delivered to the
            National Socialist German Workers Party, Boss was considered both an "activist" and a "supporter and
            beneficiary of National Socialism". In a 1946 judgment, he was stripped of his voting rights, his capacity
            to run a business, and fined "a very heavy penalty" of 100,000 DM ($70,553 U.S. dollars)(£54,008.61).[4]
            However, Boss appealed, and he was eventually classified as a ‘follower’, a lesser category, which meant
            that he was not regarded as an active promoter of National Socialism.
        </p>

        <p>He died in 1948, but his business survived. In 2011, the company issued a statement of "profound regret to
            those who suffered harm or hardship at the factory run by Hugo Boss under National Socialist rule".</p>

        <h3>Post-war</h3>

        <p>As a result of the ban on Boss being in business, his son-in-law Eugen Holy took over ownership and running
            of the company. In 1950, after a period supplying work uniforms, the company received its first order for
            men's suits, resulting in an expansion to 150 employees by the end of the year. By 1960, the company was
            producing ready made suits. In 1969, Eugen retired, leaving the company to his sons Jochen and Uwe, who
            began international development. In 1970, the first Boss branded suits were produced, with the brand
            becoming a registered trademark in 1977. This was followed by the start of the company's long association
            with motorsport, sponsoring Formula One driver Niki Lauda, and later the McLaren Racing team.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1984, the first Boss branded fragrance appeared. This helped the company gain the required growth for
            listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange the following year. The brand entered the world of golf by
            sponsoring Bernhard Langer in 1986 and entered the world of tennis by sponsoring the Davis Cup in 1987. In
            1989, Boss launched its first licensed sunglasses. Later that year, the company was bought by a Japanese
            group.
        </p>

        <p>
            After the Marzotto textile group acquired a 77.5% stake for $165,000,000 in 1991,[10][11] the Hugo and
            Baldessarini brands were introduced in 1993. In 1995, the company launched its footwear range, the first in
            a now fully developed leather products range across all sub-brands. A partnership with the Solomon R.
            Guggenheim Foundation was launched in 1995, resulting in the Hugo Boss Prize, an annual $100,000 stipend in
            modern arts presented since 1996.
        </p>

        <h3>Recent history</h3>

        <p>In 2005, Marzotto spun off its fashion brands into the Valentino Fashion Group, which was then sold to
            Permira private equity group. In March 2015, Permira announced plans to sell the remaining shareholding of
            12%. Since the exit by Permira, 91% of the shares floated on the Börse Frankfurt, and the residual 2% was
            held by the company. 7% of the shares are owned by the Marzotto family. Hugo Boss has at least 6,102 points
            of sale in 124 countries. Hugo Boss AG directly owns over 364 shops, 537 monobrand shops, and over 1,000
            franchise-owned shops.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2009, BOSS Hugo Boss was by far the largest segment, consisting of 68% of all sales. The remainder of
            sales were made up by BOSS Orange at 17%, BOSS Selection at 3%, BOSS Green at 3% and HUGO at 9%.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2010, the company had sales of $2,345,850,000 and a net profit of $262,183,000, with royalties of 42%
            of total net profit. In June 2013, Jason Wu was named artistic director of Boss Womenswear.

            In 2017, the sales of Hugo Boss climbed by 7 percent during the final quarter of the year.
